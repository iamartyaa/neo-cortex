# The Art of Prompt Engineering

You've heard it before: "Garbage in, garbage out." With LLMs, this couldn't be more true.

**Prompt engineering** is the skill of crafting inputs that get the outputs you want.

## The Basics

### Be Specific

❌ "Write about dogs"
✅ "Write a 200-word blog post about the benefits of adopting senior dogs, targeting first-time pet owners"

### Provide Context

❌ "Fix this code"
✅ "I'm building a React app with TypeScript. This component should fetch user data on mount, but it's causing an infinite loop. Here's the code: [code]"

### Use Examples (Few-Shot Learning)

```
Convert these sentences to formal English:

Informal: gonna grab some food
Formal: I am going to get some food

Informal: can't make it today
Formal: I am unable to attend today

Informal: wanna hang out later?
Formal:
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Chain of Thought

Ask the model to think step by step:

> "Solve this problem. Show your reasoning at each step before giving the final answer."

### Role Assignment

> "You are a senior software architect with 20 years of experience. Review this system design and identify potential bottlenecks."

### Structured Output

> "Respond in JSON format with the following fields: summary, key_points (array), sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)"

## The Meta-Skill

The best prompt engineers understand that they're not just writing instructions—they're **shaping the probability distribution** of the model's outputs.

Master this, and you'll 10x your productivity with AI tools.
