# Why I Switched from React to Next.js

Let me start with a confession: I was a **Create React App purist**. I loved the simplicity, the familiar folder structure, and the "just works" developer experience.

But then I discovered Next.js, and everything changed.

## The Breaking Point

My SPA was suffering from:

- **Terrible SEO**: Search engines couldn't index my content properly.
- **Slow Initial Load**: Users stared at a blank screen for 3+ seconds.
- **Complex Routing**: React Router was getting unwieldy.

## What Next.js Gave Me

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

```jsx
// This runs on the server!
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const data = await fetchFromDatabase();
  return { props: { data } };
}
```

### 2. File-Based Routing

No more `<Route path="/blog/:slug" component={BlogPost} />`. Just create a file at `pages/blog/[slug].js`. Done.

### 3. API Routes

Need a backend endpoint? Create a file in `pages/api/`. It's that simple.

### 4. Image Optimization

The `next/image` component automatically optimizes images, serves WebP, and lazy loads. My Lighthouse score jumped 30 points.

## The Verdict

Next.js isn't just React with extras—it's a complete framework for building modern web applications. The App Router in Next.js 13+ takes this even further with React Server Components.

If you're still on CRA, give Next.js a weekend. You won't go back.
