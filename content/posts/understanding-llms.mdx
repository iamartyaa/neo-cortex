# Understanding Large Language Models

Everyone's using ChatGPT, but few understand what's happening under the hood. Let's change that.

## The Transformer Architecture

At the heart of every modern LLM is the **Transformer**, introduced in the legendary 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need."

### Key Components

1. **Embeddings**: Words become vectors in high-dimensional space.
2. **Self-Attention**: The model learns which words relate to which.
3. **Feed-Forward Networks**: Processing happens in parallel.
4. **Layer Normalization**: Keeps training stable.

```
Input → Embedding → [Attention + FFN] × N → Output
```

## The Attention Mechanism

This is where the magic happens. For each word, the model asks:

> "Which other words in this sequence should I pay attention to?"

```python
# Simplified attention
attention_scores = query @ key.T / sqrt(d_k)
attention_weights = softmax(attention_scores)
output = attention_weights @ value
```

## Why Scale Matters

The "Large" in LLM isn't just marketing. Scaling laws show that:

- **More parameters** = better performance
- **More data** = better performance
- **More compute** = better performance

GPT-4 likely has over 1 trillion parameters. That's a lot of weights to tune.

## The Emergent Properties

Here's what's wild: nobody programmed these models to reason, to write poetry, or to debug code. These abilities **emerged** from scale.

We're essentially growing intelligence, not engineering it.
