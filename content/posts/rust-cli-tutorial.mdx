# Building Your First CLI Tool with Rust

Rust is famous for memory safety and performance. But it's also **fantastic** for building CLI tools.

## Why Rust for CLI?

- **Fast startup**: No runtime to initialize.
- **Single binary**: Ship one file, no dependencies.
- **Cross-platform**: Compile for Windows, Mac, Linux.
- **Great ecosystem**: `clap`, `indicatif`, `colored` make CLI dev a joy.

## Let's Build: A File Organizer

We'll create a tool that organizes files in a directory by extension.

### Step 1: Setup

```bash
cargo new file-organizer
cd file-organizer
```

### Step 2: Add Dependencies

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
clap = { version = "4.0", features = ["derive"] }
colored = "2.0"
```

### Step 3: The Code

```rust
use clap::Parser;
use colored::*;
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(name = "organize")]
#[command(about = "Organizes files by extension")]
struct Cli {
    /// Directory to organize
    #[arg(default_value = ".")]
    path: String,
}

fn main() {
    let cli = Cli::parse();
    println!("{}", "🗂️  Organizing files...".cyan().bold());
    
    // Organization logic here
    println!("{}", "✅ Done!".green().bold());
}
```

### Step 4: Build & Run

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/file-organizer ~/Downloads
```

## What's Next?

From here, you could add:

- Progress bars with `indicatif`
- Dry-run mode
- Undo functionality
- Config file support

Rust makes all of this fast and reliable. Give it a try!
