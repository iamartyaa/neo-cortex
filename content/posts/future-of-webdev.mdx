# The Future of Web Development: What's Coming in 2025

The web never stops evolving. Here's what's on the horizon.

## 1. AI-First Development

We're not replacing developers—we're **augmenting** them.

- **Copilot-style tools** will become standard.
- **AI code review** will catch bugs before humans do.
- **Natural language to code** will handle boilerplate.

The developers who thrive will be those who learn to collaborate with AI, not compete against it.

## 2. Edge Computing Goes Mainstream

Why send requests to a data center in Virginia when you can compute at the edge, milliseconds from your users?

- **Cloudflare Workers**
- **Vercel Edge Functions**
- **Deno Deploy**

The edge is where the action is.

## 3. WebAssembly Everywhere

WASM is breaking out of the browser:

- **Server-side WASM** with Spin and Fermyon
- **Plugin systems** powered by WASM
- **Near-native performance** in the browser

Languages like Rust, Go, and even Python are compiling to WASM.

## 4. The Death of the Monolith (Again)

Micro-frontends are gaining traction:

- **Module Federation** in Webpack 5
- **Single-SPA** for framework-agnostic composition
- **Islands Architecture** (Astro, Fresh)

Build big apps from small, independent pieces.

## 5. Sustainability Matters

Green hosting, carbon-aware computing, and efficient code aren't just nice-to-haves anymore.

- Measure your app's carbon footprint
- Optimize for energy efficiency
- Choose green hosting providers

The future is bright, fast, and increasingly intelligent. Are you ready?
